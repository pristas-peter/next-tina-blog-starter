# Next.js static blog starter + TinaCMS

This example project uses Next.js' [blog starter](https://next-blog-starter.now.sh/) and adds Tina to it according to the [Tina boostrapping guide](https://tinacms.org/guides/nextjs/adding-tina/overview).

## A starting point for Tina-powered websites

This demo isn't a full-featured CMS. It is a starting point, that takes care of the first steps of setting up Tina, designed to be a good starting point for working with Tina.

## How to use

Install dependencies and run the example:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev

# or

yarn install
yarn dev
```

Your blog should be up and running on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)!

Deploy it to the cloud with [Vercel](https://vercel.com/import?filter=next.js&utm_source=github&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=next-example) ([Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment)).
